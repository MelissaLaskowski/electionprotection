Stephen Cerbone
Stephen's work was primarily on the Database, the backend server, and communication between those and the front-end/user-facing forms. He created all of the tables in the database and the script to initialize the database on a new system. He worked on the server code, handling input from users, performing necessary checks and sending requests to the database, per input recieved. He also hooked the forms on the front end pages to the backend server, creating the neccessary GET and POST requests with the required parameters and finally securing all of this communication with HTTPS.
